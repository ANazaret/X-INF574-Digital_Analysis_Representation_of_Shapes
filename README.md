# [Digital Representation and Analysis of Shapes (2018/19)](http://www.enseignement.polytechnique.fr/informatique/INF574/)

This is the work I did during the class of Computer Graphics http://www.enseignement.polytechnique.fr/informatique/INF574



The code is written in Java and the skeleton is provided by the teacher.

## The code provided was HORRIBLE, unstructured and inconsistent (Point_2d has different functions names from Point_3d for the same things ...) 



## I did my best to work with it :) because in the end the work asked was really fun !!
